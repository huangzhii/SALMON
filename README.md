## 1. Installation
* Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux/ with python 3 version.
* Install Pytorch, tqdm, imblearn, and lifelines.

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
conda install -c conda-forge tqdm
conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn
conda install -c conda-forge lifelines
```

### Alternative installation
To install the libraries with the specified version, `requirements.txt` can be used as a configuration file with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Run the main routine


```bash
cd experiments
python main.py
```
